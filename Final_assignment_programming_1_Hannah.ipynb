Therefore a scatter plot was created. The percentage of change of a chosen bird species is plotted against the percentage of change of a agriculture subject. A regression line is also created and the R squared is calculated. With this plot is easy to see per bird species and agriculture subject if there is a correlation between the two parameters. With this plot, the question could be answered. But because of the many parameters, it is still hard to see which bird species are influenced and how many bird species are influenced by agriculture.\n",

    "### Discussion/Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research question\n",
    "The research question of this research was: What is the effect of agriculture on the population of breeding birds in the Netherlands? It was expected that agriculture did have an effect on the population of breeding birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data quality and quantity\n",
    "A lot of data was missing , and for some bird species there was no data at all from some of the regions.  Also, when comparing the two dataframes, there was an overlap of only 21 years of data. Some of the bird species had a missing data because the bird indexing started later than the year 2000. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The used plots\n",
    "First, a line plot was created to visualize data of the agricultural practices and the bird indexes. With this plot it is easy to see if a bird population changed together with an agricultural practice. But unfortunately was this graph not enough to have an idea about the influence of  all the different agricultural practices on the bird species. To make a more broad visualization, a bar plot was created with all the data. With this bar plot it was easy to see in one look what happened to all the bird species and agricultural practices. The percentage of change between 2000 and 2020 was used as a value to normalize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the data was visualized using the line and bar plot. But the plots did not say anything about correlation between the two datasets. That is why a scatter plot was created with the change percentage of the bird species plotted against the change percentage of the agricultural practices. In this plot a regression line and a R square was added. Using this graph it can be concluded if there is a correlation between the population change of a bird species and the change of an agricultural practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these plots did not easily show which bird species was affected by which agricultural practice. That is why a correlation heatmap was created with the agricultural practices on the y axis, the bird species on the x axis. This way it was better to determine which agricultural practice had an effect on which bird species.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Found correlations\n",
    "The five birds with the strongest correlations:\n",
    "    Common Eider, \n",
    "    Barnacle Goose, \n",
    "    Common pochard,\n",
    "    Red-crested Pochard,\n",
    "    Common qual\n",
    "\n",
    "The heatmap suggests that there are some positive and negative correlations. To confirm that these correlations are true, more research is required for this subject, preferably with data from more than 12 regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final conclusion\n",
    "It seems that some of the bird populations are influenced by some agricultural practices and the majority of the bird populations not. There is not data enough data to say that there is or is not a correlation between the two parameters. Also, other factors such as rainfall and infrastructure were not taken into account during this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it can be concluded that agricultural practices might have a positive and negative effect on some of the breeding bird populations, however further research is required to confirm this.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future studies it is recommended to use data from more than only 12 regions, use data from a bigger timeframe, and to take other factors, such as rainfall and infrastructure, into account .\n"
